MITIE: MIT Information Extraction
=====

This project provides free (even for commercial use) [state-of-the-art](../../wiki/Evaluation) information extraction 
tools. This first release includes a named entity recognizer.  Subsequent versions will add tools for part 
of speech tagging, relationship extraction, interfaces for training your own custom extractors, and various other tools.  

The first release of MITIE includes only a C API.  However the next releases will add 
easy to use bindings to other langauges beginning with python and java.

# Using MITIE

The MITIE C API is documented in the [mitie.h](mitielib/include/mitie.h) header file.
There is also an [example NER program](examples/C/ner_example.c) that shows how to use it in the examples folder.  

If you obtained MITIE by cloning the main repository then you must first fetch the two 
submodules (dlib and MITIE-models).  Do this by running fetch_submodules.sh. 
Then, to compile the example program type the following commands:
```
make examples
```
Then you can run the example by typing:
```
./mitie_ner MITIE-models/ner_model.dat sample_text.txt 
```

The above works on most Unix like systems.  For Windows and other platforms we have provided [CMake](http://www.cmake.org)
build scripts.  To compile using CMake you would use this alternative set of commands:
```
cd examples/C
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Finally, you can create a MITIE shared library by executing:
```
cd mitielib
make
```
And again, ths will work on most Unix systems but if you are on a platform where it doesn't you can use
the provided CMake files in the mitielib folder.  So type the following to compile MITIE as a shared library using CMake:
```
cd mitielib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
