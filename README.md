MITIE: MIT Information Extraction
=====

This project provides free (even for commercial use)
[state-of-the-art](../../wiki/Evaluation) information extraction
tools. This first release includes a named entity recognizer.
Subsequent versions will add tools for part of speech tagging,
relationship extraction, interfaces for training your own custom
extractors, and various other tools.

The first release of MITIE includes only a C API.  However the next
releases will add easy to use bindings to other langauges beginning
with python and java.

# Using MITIE

The MITIE C API is documented in the
[mitie.h](mitielib/include/mitie.h) header file.  There is also an
[example NER program](examples/C/ner_example.c) that shows how to use
it in the examples folder.

# Building MITIE (Unix-like systems)

If you obtained MITIE by cloning the main repository then you must first fetch the
submodules (dlib).  Do this by running `fetch_submodules.sh`. 
Then, to compile the examples type the following command:

```
make examples
```

You can download example models trained on English texts here:
```
make MITIE-models
```
These models are required for the examples below:

```
./ner_example MITIE-models/ner_model.dat sample_text.txt 
```

This command runs `ner_example` using the `ner_model.dat` sample
model. A summary of the entities found in `sample_text.txt` will be
printed out to the `STDOUT`.

Alternatively, you can tell MITIE to process each line of a text file
independently and output marked up text with the command:

```
cat sample_text.txt | ./ner_stream MITIE-models/ner_model.dat  
```

You can also run a simple regression test to validate your build, run
the following command:

```
make test
```

`make test` builds both the example programs and downloads required
example models.  If you require a non-standard C++ compiler, change
`CC` in `examples/C/makefile` and in `tools/ner_stream/makefile`.

# Building MITIE (non-Unix systems)

The above works on most Unix-like systems.  For Windows and other platforms we have provided [CMake](http://www.cmake.org)
build scripts.  To compile using CMake you would use this alternative set of commands:

```
cd examples/C
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Finally, you can create a MITIE shared library by executing:

```
cd mitielib
make
```

And again, ths will work on most Unix systems but if you are on a platform where it doesn't you can use
the provided CMake files in the mitielib folder.  So type the following to compile MITIE as a shared library using CMake:

```
cd mitielib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
